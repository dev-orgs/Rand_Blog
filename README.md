Business Requirement Document
Project: Blog Platform Backend Development
1. Project Overview
   The objective of this project is to develop the backend for a blog platform application. The platform will allow users to create, manage, and read blog posts. The application will be built using Java and Spring Boot, with PostgreSQL as the database. Students are also required to integrate a single external API to enhance the platform's functionality.
2. Functional Requirements
   Core Features:
- User Management: The application should allow users to register, log in, and manage their profiles.
- Blog Management: Users should be able to create, edit,get and delete blog posts.
- Commenting System: Users should be able to comment on blog posts.
- Like System: Users should be able to like blog posts.
- Search Functionality: Implement a search feature to allow users to search for blog posts by title or content.

External API Integration:
- The application must Integrate a quote API to display a random inspirational quote at the beginning or end of each blog post.

3. Non-Functional Requirements
   Performance:
- The application should handle up to 1000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- All database queries must be optimized for performance.

Security:
- The application should use JWT tokens for securing API endpoints.
- All sensitive data must be encrypted, both at rest and in transit.

4. Database Requirements
   PostgreSQL:
- The application must use PostgreSQL as the database management system.
- Database schema must include tables for users, blog posts, comments, and likes.

5. Conclusion
   This project is designed to simulate a real-life development scenario where students will gain hands-on experience in developing a robust backend application using modern technologies. The focus will be on writing clean, maintainable code, and following best practices for security and performance.
   Good luck with your project!
